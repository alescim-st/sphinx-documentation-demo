General
=======

How Do I Get Access to the NIH-NEI GitHub Organization? 
--------------------------------------------------------
If you don't already have an existing GitHub account (or if you don't want to use your personal one), you will need to `create one <https://github.com/join>`_. 
Next, you can request access to the organization by submitting a ticket to the `IT service desk. <https://myitsm.nih.gov/>`_ 
In the ticket, include your GitHub username, a brief justification for the request, and your supervisor.

Do I login with my GitHub or NIH credentials? 
--------------------------------------------------------
You use both. You first log in with your GitHub credentials. Then you will log in with your NIH credentials once you visit a page within the NEI GitHub organization.

How Do I Create a Repository?
--------------------------------------------------------
GitHub has created a `helpful tutorial <https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/>`_, which will help you get started. Be sure to set the owner to NIH-NEI to make the repo part of the organization like in the image featured below:

What Should I Put into a Repository? 
--------------------------------------------------------
Repositories are for code, documentation, and small sample data. You should not include full datasets or any PHI/PII in a repository.

Management and Sharing
======================

Why Don’t I Have Permissions to Do Certain Tasks? 
--------------------------------------------------------

You will need to submit a ticket to the IT service desk to do the following:

* **Make a repository public** (include repo URL, justification, and supervisor name in request)
* **Create a team** (include team name, team description, and supervisor name in request)
* **Delete/archive a repo** (include repo URL, justification, and supervisor name in request)

What Application(s) Should I Use to Manage My Repos? 
--------------------------------------------------------

.. tip::

    If you are new to Git and GitHub, you should try `GitHub Desktop <https://desktop.github.com/>`_. 
    Installing this requires help from an administrator via a service desk ticket, but the application is approved (white listed) for installation at NEI.

.. list-table:: Many editors have useful GitHub extensions developed for them:

:octicon:`note` How Do I Share My Repositories with Collaborators? 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whoever you share your repository with will also need to belong to the NEI GitHub organization. 
You can :bdg-link-primary-line:`share it with them directly or via a team <https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-teams-and-people-with-access-to-your-repository#inviting-a-team-or-person>`. 
If you find yourself regularly sharing your repos with the same people, you should use a GitHub team. 
You can `submit a ticket <https://myitsm.nih.gov/>`_ to create a team.

This is an example :bdg-link-primary:`explicit title <https://example.com>`

Licensing
=========

What License Should I Use?
--------------------------------------------------------

NEI employees are encouraged to use this `modified BSD 3-clause license <https://github.com/NIH-NEI/NEI-Bioinformatics-Core/blob/main/LICENSE>`_.
It should be included in the top level directory of your repository in a file called LICENSE. 
You will need to edit the AUTHORS and the SOFTWARE section.

I’ve Modified Code with an Existing Open Source License. How Should I Distribute It? 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It depends on the license. In the case of a GPL license, `the code would still be covered by the GPL, although your modifications would not be copyrighted <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#GPLUSGovAdd>`_.

How Do I Handle Third-Party Contributions?
--------------------------------------------------------

If you accept any third-party contributions from individuals outside of the NIH, their changes should be licensed with 
`an unmodified BSD 3-clause license <https://github.com/NIH-NEI/NEI-Bioinformatics-Core/blob/main/docs/licenses/LICENSE.BSD-3-Clause>`_. 
This license should be included in the top level directory of your repository in a file called LICENSE.BSD-3-Clause. 
You should also include `this CONTRIBUTING file <https://github.com/NIH-NEI/NEI-Bioinformatics-Core/blob/main/docs/licenses/CONTRIBUTING>`_ 
to inform contributors that their contributions will be licensed under a BSD 3-clause license.
