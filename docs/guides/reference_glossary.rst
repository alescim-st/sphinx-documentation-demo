    Directive
        Directives are special commands that can be embedded as text into an rST document.
        They can be used to dictate how content in the document gets formatted by Sphinx. 

        For example, having this in a document:

        .. code-block:: rst

            .. admonition:: title

                content

        ... would generate this:

        .. admonition:: title

            content


    rST
       reStructuredText is a plaintext markup language that Sphinx can use to generate documentation.
       This will be the standard way we write documentation in this project. Mardown is an alternative langauge.

       See this `cheat sheet <https://github.com/ralsina/rst-cheatsheet/blob/master/rst-cheatsheet.rst>`_ for the common markup used in rST files.
